1. We can use a Finite State Machine (FSM) to model the interaction between the OS and your program.

On a piece of paper, 
   - draw the Process Status Diagram (PSD) on a piece of paper
   - label both it states and edges
   - take a picture your drawing
   - upload your picture to your computer
   - export your picture in PNG format with the name "PSD.png"
   - copy your "PSD.png" to this directory.<br>

1. An ISA is an abstraction for a physical computer.  This abstraction includes a defined set of characteristics.  Enumerate these defined characteristics.

   1.                                                     <!-- response -->

<!-- You may add additional lines as needed; remember to add respons tags.  -->

1. Briefly describe the difference between a Sequential circuit and a Combinational Circuit.

   ```response


   ```

   <!-- You may add additional lines within the code block above, without the need to added additional response tag. -->


1. Define the following terms:
   1. trap
      -                                                    <!-- response -->
   1. kernel
      -                                                    <!-- response -->
   1. rval
      -                                                    <!-- response -->
   1. interrupt
      -                                                    <!-- response -->


1. A 'Universal Computer' is an abstract machine based upon the Turing Machine.  This computer has a standardized control program to manage the underlying finite state machine. (This control program is akin to the computer firmware).  Two other programs are placed on the tape.  What are these two other programs:
  1.                                                      <!-- response -->
  1.                                                      <!-- response -->


1. A Pushdown Automata (PDA) has more computational power than a Finite State Machine (FSM). What is the difference between the PDA and and FSM that provides the PDA with this additional power?
   1.                                                     <!-- response -->
   1.                                                     <!-- response -->



1. Memory can be modeled as an array of bytes.  A register on the MIPS architecture contains 32 bits.  What role does endiance play when we execute an instruction to load a register with values stored within memory.
   ```response
              
              
   ```

1. Given the following configuration of memory, answer the following questions:
   1. What is the value stored in memory at location `0x0100 0002`: 
      -                                                   <!-- response -->
   1. What is the label associated with location `0x0100 0009` in memory
      -                                                   <!-- response -->
   1. What is the lval associated with `B`:  
      -                                                   <!-- response -->
   1. What is the rval associated with `B`:
      -                                                   <!-- response -->
